# Managing Resources

One of the main benefits of Launch is the ability to quickly deploy changes to rules, data elements, and extensions to your web pages and mobile applications without having to republish your pages or resubmit your applications. Each rule, data element or extension is considered a resource. To publish any changes to your resources you must first group them into a library. Creating a new library will allow you to select which changes you want to publish together. This is an important and powerful tool, as there may be a set of rules that you are working on but have not finished or wish to embargo till a later time, or an extension that you wish to test in development, while publishing other changes into production.
