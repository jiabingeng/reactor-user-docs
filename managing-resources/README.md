# Managing Resources

One of the main benefits of Launch is the ability to quickly deploy changes to rules, data elements, and extensions to your web pages and mobile applications without having to republish your pages or resubmit your applications. Each rule, data element or extension is considered a resource. 

To publish changes to your resources, you must first group the resources into a library. Creating a library allows you to select the changes that you want to publish together. This is an important and powerful tool, because there might be a set of rules that you are working on but have not finished or embargo until a later time, or an extension that you want to test in development, while publishing other changes into production.
